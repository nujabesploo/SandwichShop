# 🥪 SandwichShop: Age-Based Sandwich Pricing Calculator

A Java console application that simulates a sandwich shop ordering system. This program dynamically calculates sandwich prices based on the customer's age and selected options, including sandwich size and whether they want toppings.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 🟢 **The program starts** and prompts the user for sandwich size and topping preferences.
2. 🧾 **Users provide input** for:
   - Sandwich size: `Regular` or `Large`
   - Toppings: `Yes` or `No`
   - Customer age: Used to determine eligibility for discounts
3. 💸 **Discounts are calculated**:
   - **Students (≤17)** receive a 10% discount
   - **Seniors (≥65)** receive a 20% discount
4. ➕ **Topping charges are added**:
   - `$1.00` for Regular, `$1.75` for Large sandwiches
5. 📋 **Final price is displayed**, showing the user exactly what they'll pay.
